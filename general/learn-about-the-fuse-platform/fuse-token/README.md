# Curval Token (Curval)

The Curval token is the native currency of the Curval blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## Curval utility:

- **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Curval blockchain, Curval is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
- **Validation** Token holders can stake Curval to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.Curvalscan.org/](https://status.Curvalscan.org/))
- **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked Curval. Which means validators with higher amounts of Curval staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
- **Staking (for delegators)** Any Curval holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of Curval they wish. They receive a share of the Curval block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
- **Payments** As Curval is the native currency on Curval, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, Curval transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of Curval tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Curval platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
